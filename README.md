# Dino Nuggets: A multiplayer game

A multiplayer game with two dinosaurs trying to run home, with gameplay inspired by the google chrome dinosaur game, game perspective inspired by subway surfers, and game art inspired by crossy road.

Currently, the vision for the game is to have a split screen with a dinosaur on each side. There are three lanes for each dinosaur (similar to SubwaySurfers), and obstacles, like cacti and pterodactyls, will pop up as the dinosaur runs forward. Either player will be able to shoot the pterodactyls with a button, which will send them to the other split screen, making it harder for the other player as they will have more obstacles to avoid. The game ends when one of the players gets hit by an obstacle.


## Getting started

To get started:
1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/javibavi/dino-nuggets.git
```
2. Check what branches there are
```bash
git branch -r
```
3. Switch to the branch that you are assigned to:
```bash
git checkout <name-of-branch>
```
4. Start Working!

## Branches and Assignments:

This will be a list of all the tasks that need to be done. A branch will likely be created for each feature that needs to be implemented:
- Find a way to take user input from our controller and move our dinosaur
- Create the code to generate the obstacles in the environment
- Configure the camera of our game (should be easy)
- Create 3D models for our environment
- Implement a start menu and a settings menu
